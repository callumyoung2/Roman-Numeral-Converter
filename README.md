# RomanNumeralConverter
This is a Roman numeral converter written in Python that I made as part of a challenge taken from codewars.com.
It accurately converts Roman numerals to numbers and vice-versa. 
One thing to note is that this code was written using a static class in Python, which doesn't seem conventional to me, but that was the format that the challenge specified.
